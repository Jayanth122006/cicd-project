  # Any request starting with /api/ will be proxied to our backend service.
  # 'backend' is the name of our Spring Boot service in docker-compose.yml.

  # Rule 2: Handle frontend routing (React Router)
  # For any other request that is not a file, serve the index.html file.
  # This allows React Router to handle all the client-side routing.
